# Advent of Code 2022: A collection of solutions  

This is my first year doing AOC and I decided this was a good time to finally learn Python.  My background is C, Java and Javascript so this is a nice departure, but the lack of parenthesis and line endings makes me die a little inside.

These are my solutions, they seem to work, the code is probably sloppy at times. Use at your own risk.
